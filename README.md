##Introduction <br/><br/>
With the situation around the world. Every individual wants to be carried along about the present situation which is the virus that is rapidly spread across the world.
<br/><br/>
I created a webapp where users can get the latest update about the virus. The app shows the recovery rate to death rate and shows the total cases of the people infected, providing a map and a chart for better use.<br/><br/>
I made use of REACT & REDUX to get all running, making use of the disease.sh API. i made use of hooks and dependencies like chart.js, react-leaflet, numeral and many more.
